- JavaScript/HTML/CSS
- Ajax/jQuery
- curl
- Bootstrap/SASS/FlexBox

## Planning
I planned this out mainly by spending a bit of time thinking about the kind of game that I would like to play. I'm a "visual" person so I went at it from what I wanted the finished product to look like and tried to figure out how to get there from where I presently was. The ultimate concept was to create "WOPR/Joshua", or it's likeness, and put him into a mobile platform. Obviously, due to copyright, I couldn't directly borrow from the movie ("WarGames" if you haven't seen it), so I treated this like an homage piece for this century.

The first thing I built was the authentication interaction with the API. Moving forward from there, I continued by building a rough game UI that would allow basic interaction with the board game. Next came the game engine where I dug a little deeper into the logic, following that up with another layer of the game UI. Next came building the interaction with the game API along with final touches on the CSS.

## Challenges
Let me start off by saying, there's a reason that this is version one. The biggest struggles I experienced were interacting with the game API and pieces of the game logic. JavaScript is a new language for me (along with the more advanced pieces of HTML & CSS) so this was really jumping into the proverbial deep end. There were times where I had a basically working product which would then break and the process of troubleshooting would just cause more errors (read: #developerproblems). Ultimately, I loved the experience of the project - I really enjoyed the highs of getting my code to work, but like any fledgling/initial endeavor, there were a lot (and I do mean a lot) of lows. I have a feeling that this will be a project I'll be tinkering with for the next six months until I get it just the way I want it, learning throughout the process (which is exactly what this was from the beginning - a great learning experience).
